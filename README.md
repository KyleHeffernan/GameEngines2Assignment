The scene will start in the Milano with some audio explaining that rocket just stole
batteries from the Sovereign before they left. As they talk, there is an impact at the back of the ship.

They see the Sovereign fleet is behind them, announcing that they know they stole the batteries, but rocket keeps flying away and the fleet opens fire at the Milano. A chase begins and the camera follows.
